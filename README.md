# üõ°Ô∏è System Threat Forecaster - Malware Infection Prediction

This project is part of a machine learning competition to predict a system‚Äôs probability of getting infected by various families of malware. The data consists of telemetry properties collected from antivirus software logs.

---

## üöÄ Problem Statement

The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can **predict the probability of malware infection** based on system properties. The telemetry data includes various system configurations, usage patterns, and security settings.

---

## üìä Dataset

The dataset includes anonymized telemetry data collected from systems. Each row corresponds to a system, and the target is a label indicating infection by a specific malware family.

## üß† ML Techniques Used

- **Data Preprocessing**:
  - Handling missing values
  - Encoding categorical variables
  - Scaling numerical features
  - Variance filtering

- **Class Imbalance Handling**:
  - SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique)

- **Modeling**:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Random Forest
  - Decision Tree
  - XGBoost
  - Ridge, Lasso, SGD Classifiers
  - SVM
  - Ensemble models: Bagging, AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting, Stacking

- **Evaluation Metrics**:
